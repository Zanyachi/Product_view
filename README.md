## My process

I started with a mobile first view, after writing the html. I designed from top down, only coming back later for the ones I missed and the ones I had to research. I used media queries for designing the desktop view while still practicing other methods of responsive web design.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS media queries
- [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For fonts


### What I learned

I learnt how to use media queries while working on this project and how to build cards with images too. I als learnt how to use google fonts and how to link it to my my html.


### Continued development

I want to focus more on grounding my media queries knowledge, studying the media types and features.

### Useful resources

- [Image cards](https://youtu.be/qXRYMdvq_Dc?si=AZ_YmGl7VA4lH2lQ) - This video helped me learn how to create image cards.
- [Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
